        This cheese omelette is great for breakfast. To make a delicious cheese omelette, follow these step-by-step instructions:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Step 1:</b> Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. 
            Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2:</b> Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. 
            Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. 
            Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the 
            skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until 
            no visible liquid egg remains.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Step 3:</b> Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
            Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese 
            is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.
        </li>
    
    </ul>
