        To make a delicious lasagna, follow these step-by-step instructions:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat Oven: Set your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Prepare Meat Sauce: In a pan, brown 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of Italian sausage with diced onions
            and garlic. Add tomato sauce and seasonings, simmer for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix Cheeses: In a bowl, combine 1 pound of ricotta cheese, 1 egg, and some mozzarella and parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Layer Ingredients: In a baking dish, spread a layer of meat sauce, then place lasagna noodles, followed by
            the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers (sauce, noodles, cheese) until all ingredients are used, finishing
            with sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove foil, add more mozzarella and parmesan on top, and
            bake for an additional 15 minutes until bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Cool and Serve: Let it rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy! </li>
